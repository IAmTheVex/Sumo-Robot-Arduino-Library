# Arduino Sumo Robot Library

My, #noName(aka: Ciobanu Laurentiu), and my mate #noFear
(aka: Tenea Mihai) are bringing to you, robotics fan and 
lover, to you, the one witch played with the mini sumo
or micro sumo robot for ages and you can't make it work
like you would like, this very simple and efficient way
to make your sumo robot, just better!
We present to you, the first version of: 
* The Arduino Sumo Robot Library * !
It's a quick way to make your sumo robot better,
make it think faster, make decisions better, control
it more easily! Shrink your very complicated software
to just 10 lines of code ...
Use the benefits of timer interrupts, without catching
your nose into the ATmega datasheets trying to find
out what register should go where to give you the
best results. With this library in not more complicated
than this:

SumoRobot sumo();
sumo.initSumo('C', motors[]);

Yes! With 2 lines of code you've got timer interrupts! :)

The main library is split up into 3 main categories:
- easy timer interrupts control
- fast and easy use and access of all your sensors
- advanced motors control for any type of motor drive
you use (with 3 control wires/motor or with 
2 control wires/motor).
Yes, it's just that easy. Define your pins and you are done!
The library will do the rest of the job for you ... :)

Before I go:
Keep in mind just one thing: the library is in the alpha
preview release, so if you have any problem or issues,
contact as at alpharoboticsteam@gmail.com or at my 
personal email address: ciobanulaur@gmail.com.

Good luck with your project, and I hope that this might
help you.
	Bye, and see you at the lunch of the beta version!
